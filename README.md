# Learn French articles
French is sometimes a frustrating language to learn, particularly for the gendered articles of words: "la chaise, la table, le vase, etc". A few friends complained about this for years, leading me to create this little online quiz to help them practice.

The examples are pulled from Jules Verne's "20000 Lieues sous les Mers", and will prompt users to guess the correct (or at least compatible) articles for sentences pulled from the novel. Points are given for precision.

You can find the quiz hosted at [miguelboland.me/learn_french](miguelboland.me/learn_french).

Enjoy!
